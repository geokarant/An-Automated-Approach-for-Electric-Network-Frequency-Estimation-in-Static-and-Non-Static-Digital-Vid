# An-Automated-Approach-for-Electric-Network-Frequency-Estimation-in-Static-and-Non-Static-Digital-Video-Recordings
This is a Matlab implementation of An-Automated-Approach-for-Electric-Network-Frequency-Estimation-in-Static-and-Non-Static-Digital-Video-Recordings journal paper.

# run main_VIDEO.m

In order to run the framework developed in the proposed work for automated ENF estimation in static and non-static digital video recordings, run the script main_VIDEO.m. Note: main_VIDEO.m takes as input an .mp4 file of the recorded video and a ground truth ENF signal. Its output derives the maximum correlation coefficient between the estimated ENF and the ground truth.
